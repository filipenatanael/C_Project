# C Programming Language

In subfolders in this directory you will find the my homeworks write in C Programming Language, this codes was developed when I was studying computer science at Belo Horizonte University, I will always remember those days because it was one of my first contacts with computing and technology. It was really amazing and it still is.


### List of algorithms

Some of the algorithms developed:

* [Strings Samples Manipulation] - Some example of how we can handle strings
* [Struct Exercises 1] - C Structure with examples
* [File Manipulation] - Using C Language to manipulate files
* [Manipulation Binary Files] - How can we work using binary files
* [Manipulation Binary Files] - How can we work using binary files
* [Reference Pointers] - Adjusting values using pointers
