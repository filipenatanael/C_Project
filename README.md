# C Programming Language

In subfolders in this directory you will find the my homeworks using C Programming Language, this codes was developed when I was studying computer science at Belo Horizonte University, I will always remember those days because it was one of my first contacts with computing and technology. It was really amazing and it still is.


### List of algorithms

Some of the algorithms developed:

* [Strings Samples Manipulation](https://github.com/filipenatanael/C_Project/tree/master/Strings%20Samples%20Manipulation) - Some example of how we can handle strings
* [Struct Exercises 1](https://github.com/filipenatanael/C_Project/tree/master/Struct%20Exercises%201) - C Structure with examples
* [File Manipulation](https://github.com/filipenatanael/C_Project/tree/master/FIle%20Manipulation) - Using C Language to manipulate files
* [Manipulation Binary Files](https://github.com/filipenatanael/C_Project/tree/master/FIle%20Manipulation) - How can we work using binary files
* [Reference Pointers](https://github.com/filipenatanael/C_Project) - Adjusting values using pointers
* [Stacks, Files and Chain Lists](https://github.com/filipenatanael/C_Project/tree/master/Trabalho_Listas_Pilhas_Filas) - working with Stacks, Files and Chain Lists


### College project - [Extra Class]

* [Naval Battle Combat](https://github.com/filipenatanael/C_Project/blob/master/NavalBattleCombat%20_v1.cpp) - Building a naval battle for 2 players
* [Telephone directory v3 Oficial](https://github.com/filipenatanael/C_Project/blob/master/TelephoneDirectory_v3_Oficial.cpp) - Creating a Telephone directory using using Struct, Linked lists techniques.


### it's free,clone if you need:
